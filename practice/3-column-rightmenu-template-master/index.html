				<h1>Pi Beta Phi's History</h1>
				<p> Pi Beta Phi was founded at Monmouth College at Monmouth, Illinois on April 28th, 1867. There were 12 founders of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity: Nancy Black, Libby Brook, Clara Brownlee, Ada Bruen, Margaret Campbell, Jennie Horne, Rosa Moore, Jennie Nicol, Fannie Tomson and Fannie Whitenack.</p>
				<h1>Our Sisterhood</h1>
				<p>Our sisterhood is unique because every chapter within every university is unique. The sisters of Pi Beta Phi, Virginia Zeta Chapter are very involved on campus. May of our sisters are involved in Virginia Tech's Relay for Life, which is the largest collegiate relay in the nation. As sisters of Pi Beta Phi and Hokies at Virginia Tech, we are all so proud to support causes that we care about and integrate those causes into our sisterhood. We are truly lucky to have such a diverse and passionate group of women to represent the Virginia Zeta chapter of Pi Beta Phi!  </p>
				<h1>Philanthropy</h1>
				<p>As sisters of Pi Beta Phi we support our national philanthropy Read>Lead>Achieve. Across America 1 in every 4 children is illiterate and the sisters of Pi Beta Phi believe that is one too many. It is our mission to support literacy in any way that we can in order to educate children and make sure that they grow up to reach their full potential.</p>
				<h1>Why Pi Beta Phi?</h1>
				<p>Pi Beta Phi is a wonderful sisterhood full of women with strong values that lift each other up. As sisters, we stick together in hard time and we are always willing to lend our sisters a helping hand!</p>
