				<h1>Virginia Zeta Chapter of Pi Beta Phi</h1>
				<p> The Virginia Zeta chapter of Pi Beta Phi the chapter of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Currently, there are roughly 200 women in the VA Zeta chapter. Greek life is a big part of Virginia Tech's campus and VA Zeta is proud to be one of the twelve panhellenic sororities housed on campus at Virginia Tech's Greek hosuing complex called Oak Lane.</p>

				<h1>Finding Your Home in Pi Beta Phi</h1>
				<p> Virginia Tech hold formal recruitment the week before every spring semester. Tech believes that freshmen women should have a semester to get acclimated to college life before they join any of the chapters at Virginia Tech. Recruitment is a long and exhuasing process, but the end result is certainly worth it because hundreds of women every year find surrogate families within theri chapters which makes the campus feel smaller and allows every woman to find their "home away from home" at Virginia Tech.</p>
				<h1>Pi Beta Phamly</h1>
				<p>When women join Pi Beta Phi in the spring they eventually get 'big sisters' and these big sisters serve as guides for the new members as they are navigating their new membership. Eventually, this creates a 'family line' with grand bigs, great grand bigs, littles and bigs etc. These "phamlies" become very close and normally make up a core part of the sorority experience for women who are affiliated in every chapter.</p>
				<h1>Angel Bands</h1>
				<p>The Angel Band is the ring worn by many members of Pi Beta Phi on their middle finger on the left hand. This ring serves as a constant reminder of our bond of sisterhood and it allows Pi Phis from other chapters to identify other Pi Phis. Sisters from chapters all across the nation can spot a Pi Phi angel band and it allows sisters who don't know eachother to connect over their bond of sisterhood.</p>
