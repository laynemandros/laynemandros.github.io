				<h1> Read>Lead>Achieve </h1>
				<p>Read>Lead>Achieve is Pi Beta Phi's philanthropy that aims to encourage young people to develop a love for reading that can inspire them to achieve their dreams and become creative and passionate about the world around them. One in four children across the United States are illiterate and the sisters of Pi Beta Phi beleive that is one too many. We beleive that reading has, and always will be a core part of childhood development, which is why the sisters of Pi Beta Phi are so passionate about raising money for our philanthropy.  </p>
				<h1> Champions are Readers </h1>
				<p> Champions are readers or CAR is Pi Beta Phi's unique enrichment program for young readers. Through CAR Pi Phi works with children in kindergarten through third grade. Every week sisters from Pi Phi go to a local elementary school and help children with their reading skills. The program launched in 2003 and is active in the United States and Canada. Since the program launched it has impacted throusands of children across the nation. Children love having sisters come into class and read to them and sisters love building relationships with the children they are reading to. It is one of the most rewarding aspects of our philanthropy and Pi Beta Phi loves giving back in a way that directly impacts the people who are suffering the most from the disadvantages of illiteracy.</p>

				<h1> Dodge the Arrow </h1>
				<p> Dodge the Arrow is Virginia Zeta's annual philanthropy that benefits the Read>Lead>Achieve foundation. Every year Virginia Tech's chapter of Pi Beta Phi holds a dodge ball tournament to raise money. Throughout the week leading up to the dodge ball event there are donation booths around campus, percentage nights at local restaurants and an event called Pie a Pi Phi. Pie a Pi Phi is an event held in down town Blacksburg where people can purchase whipped cream plates and "pie" a sister of Pi Beta Phi in the face to support literacy. Every year we have tons of people come out to pie our sisters in the face in order to help raise money to end illiteracy. Then, at the end of the week there is a dodge ball torunament in which organizations such as clubs, soroities, frats etc. can register to participate in. The dodge ball torunament is always a really fun way to end a great week of raising money and awareness for our favorite cause!</p>
